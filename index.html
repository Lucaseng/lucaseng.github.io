            <h2>Great ideas have great effects. </h2>
            <p>In today's world, change is rapid. The evolution of technology. The discovery of a new drug. Now, more
                than ever, when we look at the world around us, we are greeted by great ideas in their ultimate form.
            </p>

            <p>Most people would agree (in both a literal and metaphorical sense) that today's young people are the
                answer to tomorrow. But, are we - as an education sector - sufficiently aiding young people in their ability to nurture and
                develop great ideas?
                <br><br>Personally, I don't believe we are there just yet.
                <br><br>If we want our young people to leave a tangible,
                beneficial impact on future generations, then they need to develop the ability to:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Recognise and discover their strengths</li>
                <li>Challenge deep and complex issues</li>
                <li>Think up incredible yet rational solutions</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I aspire to use my knowledge of STEM to help young people develop this. To me, it's so vital that young
                people have a way of learning that is
                more engaging than reading a textbook. It's so important that they have a way of thinking that is more
                than rote memorisation. <strong>Young people need a method
                    of teaching that plants great ideas with great effects.</strong></p>

            <p>I am currently completing my undergraduate degree at The University of Auckland. I am studying my third
                year of a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer Science and Statistics.</p>

            <p>I am scheduled to graduate in July of 2023, and am looking to begin graduate study in Secondary teaching
                at the beginning of 2024.</p>
