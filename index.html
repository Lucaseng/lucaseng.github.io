            <h2>Great ideas have great effects. </h2>
            <p>In today's world, change is rapid. The evolution of technology. The discovery of a new drug. Now, more
                than ever, when we look at the world around us, we are greeted by great ideas in their ultimate form.
            </p>

            <p>Most people would agree (in both a literal and metaphorical sense) that today's young people are the
                answer to tomorrow. But I don't believe that the education sector has evolved at the same rate that
                today's world has. That is to say, if we want our young people to leave a tangible, beneficial impact on
                future generations, then they need to develop the ability to:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Recognise and discover their strengths</li>
                <li>Challenge deep and complex issues</li>
                <li>Think up incredible yet rational solutions</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I believe we're still very much at the beginning of this journey - a journey I feel strongly inclined to
                be a part of.</p>

            <p>I aspire to use my knowledge of STEM to help young people learn differently. A way of learning that is
                more engaging than reading a textbook. A way of thinking that is more than rote memorisation. A method
                of teaching that plants great ideas with great effects.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>I am currently completing my undergraduate degree at The University of Auckland. I am studying my third
                year of a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer Science and Statistics.</p>

            <p>I am scheduled to graduate in July of 2023, and am looking to begin graduate study in Secondary teaching
                at the beginning of 2024.</p>
